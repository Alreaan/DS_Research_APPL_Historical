## Descriptive Statistics

This is an [R Markdown] for detailed Apple company stock prices dataset for the past 10 years.
source of dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/tarunpaparaju/apple-aapl-historical-stock-data

and We'll be answering the following research questions:

1- What was the change in price of the stock over time?

2- What was the daily return of the stock on average?

3- How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?


First, let's take a look at APPL stock performance in the last 10 years to see if investing in APPL was a good call or not.

Global average share price in the last 10 yrs

```{r}
apple %>% 
  summarise(mean_of_Volume = mean(Volume),
            mean_of_closing = mean(`Close/Last`))
```

as Shown average price for APPL in the last 10 years $114. 

```{r}
apple %>%
  # mutate(month = format(Date, "%m"), year = format(Date, "%Y")) %>%
  mutate (year = format(Date, "%Y")) %>% 
  group_by(year == 2020) %>%
  summarise(MEAN = mean(`Close/Last`))
```


and 2020 average price is $311 which indicates that the investment was feasible.


below plot show how stock average share price changing as there was a decline in the of 2012 and after that, APPL Stock price continued the rise for two consecutive years. a slightly price correction occurred in 2015 before launching for successive rises until this year.


```{r}
ggplot(apple_summary, aes(MEAN, year, group = 1)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "PRICE", 
       y = "YEAR", 
       title = "AVG APPL STOCK PRICE")
```

```{r}
ggplot(apple_summary, aes(year, MEAN, fill = year)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "YEAR",
       y = "PRICE",
       title = paste("APPL AVG STOCK PRICE IN LAST 10 YRS"))

```

change percentage in price of the stock over time

```{r}
ggplot(apple_summary, aes(year,  yoy_per, group = 1)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "YEAR", 
       y = "percentage", 
       title = "year-on-year percentage increase")
```
